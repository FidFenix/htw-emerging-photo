# REQUIREMENTS

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name
HTW Emerging Photo - Face and License Plate Anonymization POC

### Description
A proof-of-concept system that anonymizes faces and license plates in images by detecting them and coloring their bounding boxes with yellow to obscure sensitive information.

### Scope
This is a POC to validate the feasibility and accuracy of automated face and license plate anonymization through basic visual obscuration. It is **not** intended for production use.
