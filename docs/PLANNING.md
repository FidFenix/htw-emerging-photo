## 1. Project Overview

### Vision
Develop an AI-powered detection system that automatically identifies and locates faces and license plates in surveillance imagery from public transport environments (bus stops, metro stations) - serving as the foundation for future privacy-preserving anonymization.

### Mission Statement
Validate the technical feasibility of automated detection using state-of-the-art models (RetinaFace, YOLO) to achieve ≥90% face detection and ≥85% license plate detection accuracy within a 4-session timeline.

### Success Definition
A working POC with:
- Face detection module (RetinaFace) achieving ≥90% accuracy
- License plate detection module (YOLO) achieving ≥85% accuracy  
- REST API for integration (FastAPI)
- Web UI for demonstration (Streamlit)
- Docker deployment
- Comprehensive evaluation (quantitative + qualitative)

✅ Qualitative evaluation (visual assessment of edge cases)  

### Out of Scope
❌ Real-time video stream processing  
❌ Generative anonymization (inpainting/synthetic replacement)  
❌ Hardware optimization or edge deployment  
❌ Formal GDPR/CCPA compliance framework

⚠️ **Compute**: Single GPU, CPU-optimized inference preferred  
⚠️ **Data**: Publicly available datasets only  
⚠️ **Models**: Pre-trained models only (no custom training)  
⚠️ **Testing**: Manual validation (limited automation)

### Daily Standup Format

**Time**: Start of each session  
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes

**Questions**:
1. What did I complete in the last session?
2. What will I work on in this session?
3. Are there any blockers or risks?

**Example (Session 2)**:
- **Completed**: Environment setup, models downloaded, test dataset organized
- **Today**: Integrate RetinaFace and YOLO, build FastAPI backend
- **Blockers**: None (if GPU unavailable, will use CPU inference)

### Sprint Review (End of Session 4)

**Attendees**: Developer, Stakeholders, Project Sponsor  
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes

**Agenda**:

### Sprint Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Velocity lower than planned** | Medium | High | Prioritize high-value stories (US-1.x, US-2.x, US-3.1, US-4.1); defer medium-priority if needed |
| **Model accuracy below target** | Low | High | Use proven pre-trained models; extensive testing; adjust confidence thresholds if needed |
| **Integration issues (API-UI)** | Medium | Medium | Test incrementally; allocate time for debugging in Session 3 |
| **Dataset quality issues** | Medium | Medium | Use multiple dataset sources; manual curation; accept lower sample size if needed |
| **Time overrun** | High | High | Focus on MVP features only; defer nice-to-haves to Phase 2 |
