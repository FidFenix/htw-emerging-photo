# VALUE PROPOSITION

## Project Context

This Value Proposition is for the project **"HTW Emerging Photo - Face and License Plate Detection POC"**.

The system uses AI-based object detection (RetinaFace for faces, YOLO for license plates) to detect and locate sensitive information in images from public transport environments (bus stops, metro stations). This POC focuses on technical feasibility of automated detection as the foundation for future privacy-preserving anonymization. The detection phase is critical for identifying regions that will later be replaced with synthetic alternatives using generative models. GDPR and formal legal compliance frameworks are out of scope due to project time constraints (4-session sprint).

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Municipal and transport authorities face a critical challenge: balancing public safety through video surveillance with growing privacy and ethical concerns. This POC demonstrates an AI-powered detection system that automatically identifies faces and license plates in surveillance imagery - the essential first step toward privacy-preserving video analytics. By achieving 90%+ face detection and 85%+ license plate detection accuracy, this project validates the technical feasibility of building a full anonymization pipeline that protects individual privacy while maintaining operational value of surveillance footage.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Situation
We have **Sessions 1-4 remaining** to complete this POC project. With the project deadline approaching, we face immediate technical and operational challenges that could prevent successful delivery of the face and license plate detection system.

### Key Pain Points (Project-Specific)

#### Pain 1: Limited Time for Model Integration and Testing
- **Challenge**: Only 4 sessions to integrate RetinaFace and YOLO models, build API, and create UI
- **Risk**: Insufficient time to debug integration issues between detection models and FastAPI backend
- **Impact**: May not achieve target accuracy metrics (≥90% faces, ≥85% plates) without proper testing
- **Constraint**: Cannot afford to experiment with multiple model configurations or architectures

#### Pain 2: Dataset Availability and Validation Bottleneck
- **Challenge**: Need diverse test images (100+ samples) to validate detection across various conditions
- **Risk**: Limited time to source, label, and organize test datasets for both faces and license plates
- **Impact**: Incomplete validation could hide model failures in edge cases (poor lighting, angles, occlusion)
- **Constraint**: Manual dataset preparation competes with implementation time in remaining sessions

#### Pain 3: Streamlit UI and Demo Readiness Under Time Pressure
- **Challenge**: Must build functional Streamlit interface for image upload and result visualization
- **Risk**: UI development often reveals integration issues late in the process
- **Impact**: Incomplete demo means stakeholders cannot evaluate system capabilities effectively
- **Constraint**: Team has limited frontend expertise; debugging UI issues consumes critical final sessions

## 3. Quantifying the Problem

| Metric | Current State | Impact on Remaining Sessions |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Remaining Implementation Time** | 4 sessions | High time pressure; no buffer for setbacks |
| **Model Integration Complexity** | 2 models + API + UI | Risk of incomplete integration by deadline |
| **Test Dataset Requirement** | 100+ labeled images needed | Manual preparation competes with coding time |
| **Accuracy Validation Time** | 1-2 sessions required | Could delay final demo preparation |
