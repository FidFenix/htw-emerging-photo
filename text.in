- Anonymisation done
- NFR: to be quantified 
- Code quality: are we handling that? No
- NFR: Security to be removed
- ⁠architecture decisions record for our libraries (yolo, retina… is it trained/tested explain why) 
— why yolo v5-v8 ( yolo has three different ways) … there are different frameworks (transformers and so on) should be added..
- what is CORS 
- ⁠Concurrency ( first point to be deleted) 
- ⁠ADR-003: why PyTorch 
-we have two api contradicting,,,

- ⁠check for inconsistency ( sync or async…) - more specification needed 
- ⁠what r the classes we r using out of box
- ⁠search for yolo version for license plates already trained 
- ⁠What about fine tuning? 
- ⁠a lot of content in the planning section 
- ⁠key takeaways:
-specify models
-refine a bit

Prompt:

Update the project and add in scope, 'Anonymization of human faces and license plate cards' instead of detection of faces and license plates.
The anonymization must be basic by just coloring the bounding boxes of human faces and license plates with yellow color.


remove NFR-1.1, NFR-4, and NFR-5 from the project. Remove concurrency from performance considerations and remove the performance targets.
Regarding the api call, all of them should asynchronous.
