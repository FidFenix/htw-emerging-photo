- Anonymisation done
- NFR: to be quantified 
- Code quality: are we handling that? No
- NFR: Security to be removed
- ⁠architecture decisions record for our libraries (yolo, retina… is it trained/tested explain why) 
— why yolo v5-v8 ( yolo has three different ways) … there are different frameworks (transformers and so on) should be added..
- what is CORS 
- ⁠Concurrency ( first point to be deleted) 
- ⁠ADR-003: why PyTorch 
-we have two api contradicting,,,

- ⁠check for inconsistency ( sync or async…) - more specification needed 
- ⁠what r the classes we r using out of box
- ⁠search for yolo version for license plates already trained 
- ⁠What about fine tuning? 
- ⁠a lot of content in the planning section 
- ⁠key takeaways:
-specify models
-refine a bit
